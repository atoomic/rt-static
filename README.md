# rt-static 

rt-static is a (mostly) static RT (Request Tracker) data viewer, meant for
keeping archived data available without a full RT instance underneath.

## Tools

### server

`server` is a webserver that serves the extracted data. 

### extract/dump-json.pl

`dump-json.pl` uses the RT API to extract selected tickets, and writes one JSON
file per ticket.

### index

`index` reads the files generated by `dump-json.pl` and outputs:

* a bleve index
* `index.json` containing information used to speed up other operations.

### cli

The `cli` tool can be used to query the generated bleve index from the command
line.
